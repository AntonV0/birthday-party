# Birthday Party
## Project #58 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project is a short tutorial of how branching works on GitHub using a VS Code terminal. Two branches were created (unordered-list and big-heading) and merged to the master branch with the edited code.
## What I Learned
  - Creating (git branch branch-name), switching to (git switch branch-name), deleting (git -D branch-name), and merging (git merge branch-name) branches
  - Pushing branches to GitHub (git push -u origin branch-name)
